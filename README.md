The **Indian Premier League (IPL)**, also officially known as TATA IPL for sponsorship reasons, is a professional men's Twenty20 cricket league, contested by ten teams based out of seven Indian cities and three Indian states. The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2007. It is usually held between March and May of every year and has an exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours Programme. In this repository I analysed the data from different aspects and present my analysis in dashboard which is made by using **tableau public**.
